# Introduction
This package is a project aiming to enable automatic differentiation with Python. Automatic differentiation is a technique to find the derivative of a function computationally. Differentiation is frequently used in optimization problems. This package is developed on GitHub. 


# Background
Differentiation is super useful and widely used in maths. Some example use cases:
- finding minima/maxima in 2 or more dimensions
- 
Useful in these fields:
- Machine Learning (backpropogation is essential)
- parameter optimization (e.g. linear regression)
- physics and computational analysis: derivatives usually have some significance and value
- economic optimization problems

# Implementation

# Usage
We plan on making installation as easy as possible for the user. Ideally, the library will be hosted on PyPi and installable via
```pip install gitfighters```

Alternatively, a user can git clone the repository, ```pip install requirements.txt```, and then be able to import the necessary files manually.

Once the modules are loaded, the user will be able to use following functions and classes:
