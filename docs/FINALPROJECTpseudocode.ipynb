Utilizing the existing data structures for storing the information is especially valuable for the cases where we need to keep track of multiple functions and calculate multiple outputs. The core data structures are lists, dictionaries and arrays for storing the traces, the derivatives and outputs during the step by step process of forward AD. E.g. to accommodate the vector inputs, we will use numpy arrays.\n\n### 4.1. Classes\nWe plan to implement two classes:\n\n1. Class 1 \"Node\" - class for creating a node. The main aim of this class is to store the values, the derivatives and the outputs for each input given the variable that the Node was made for. The easy access to all of this information will give us flexibility to extend the project in any of the directions we decide to explore later. The class methods that we are thinking to implement right now are\n\n\t- value - for the value of the function evaluated at the input\n\t- derivative - evaluated derivative at the given point. We are thinking of implementing this as a dictionary, so we can store the value and the derivative-evaluation pairs, and reuse it if needed later.\n\nIt is worthwhile to mention that the methods will take inputs as Nodes and will output Nodes. This will ensure that we can still perform various operations with our outputs. \n\n2. Class 2 &quot;Methods&quot; - class for overriding all the elementary mathematical functions. We discussed that it will be cleaner to have all the methods in one class. This class will include these major methods:\n\n\t- \\_\\_str\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_eq\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_repr\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_mul\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_rmul\\_\\_\n\n\t- \\_\\_add\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_radd\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_sin\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_cos\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_tan\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_pow\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_log\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_exp\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_trudiv\\_\\_\n\t- \\_\\_rtruediv\\_\\_\n\n3. While we will create most of the classes, data structures and methods from scratch for our own use, we will still utilize some basic external libraries and dependencies such as:\n\n    1. Travis Ci for tests\n    2. Codecove for code coverage\n    3. NumPy for mathematical operations and array data structures\n\n### 4.2 Handling the elementary functions:\n\nAll the elementary functions will be overridden by us. Additionally, all the elementary functions will be able to take the input as Nodes and output Nodes. In our overridden function we will use self.value and self.derivative for evaluating the value and the derivative of the output Node.\n\n```\ndef exp(Node):\n\t### calculate the value\n\tnew_value = np.exp(node.point)\n\t\n\t### calculate the derivative\n\tnew_derivative = np.exp(node.point) * node.derivative\n\n\t### update the trace table if we decide to implement it\n\tâ€¦ (will skip for now)\n\n\treturn Node(new_value, new_derivative)\n```\n\n## 5 Usage\nWe plan on making installation as easy as possible for the user. The package will be hosted on PyPi and installable via ```pip install gitfighters```\n\nAlternatively, a user can git clone the repository, ```pip install requirements.txt```, and then be able to import the necessary files manually.\n\nOnce the modules are loaded, the user will be able to use the code as follows:\n\nEvaluating a function like $f(x) = 200 + x^3$ at point x = (-2):\n\n```\nfrom gitfighters import Node\n\n# instantiate the trace variables\na = Node(-2)\nb = 200\n\n# perform elementary operations on them\nv1 = a.exp(3)\nv2 = a + v1\n# ...\n#  all elementary operations done\n```\nUser can then access the function value and derivative value by:\n\n```\nprint(v2.fnc_val, v2.drv_val)\n>>> 192, 12\n```\n\nAlternatively, user can skip doing all the elementary operations manually and just call ```drv_eval(f, x)```, feeding it a mathematical function and a point (or vector) at which it should be evaluated like follows:\n```\nfrom gitfighters import drv_eval\n\ndef func(x):  # example mathematical function\n\treturn 200 + x**3\n\nx = -2  # point at which we want func() evaluated\n\nevaluation = drv_eval(func, x)\nprint(evaluation)\n>>> 192, 12\n```\n\nThis will also be doable with vector inputs/outputs.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00009-7d60d615-1a6e-4efb-8977-492368e9ebd6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00010-6ec287cb-c032-40c5-9efe-997ca7a6a59c"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"944aaa30-0140-45a3-b6e8-f2272a49385e","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
